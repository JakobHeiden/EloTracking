was ist das problem mit den rank roles?
""Skyyy â€” 09/03/2023 23:59
  Any idea how to fix the bot from only giving one player roles when a match ends?
cause in a 3v3 only 1 of the 6 gets a role
it specifically removed the roles??? -> bugs channel

I tried temp bans but didn't understand how to use another unit besides minutes for duration. It always defaulted to minutes.

A command to view the ban list would be helpful to, seemed like the account I was trying to ban was still able to queue

Also, does the bot DM the banned person when they are initially banned or when they try using a command?
