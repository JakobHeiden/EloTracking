Casual Game
 /scrims creates 2 channels
1- #open-games
2- #games-archive

=>player can create an open-game by /create => bot DM series of questions asking about game details (for now i can only think of 2 questions)
1-game type (1v1,2v2,ffa ...)
2-game details (rules, settings, mods required ...)

=>bot posts embed message in #open-games (contain all  questions answers, name of creator, players joined ), the message has a button to request to join the game which will send a DM request to game creator to accept or refuse (then bot DM the player who wants to join of creator's choice)

=> bot will also  creates a private channel for creator + accepted players
accepted players can leave the game by using a command (ex: /leave)

-game creator can use a command (ex: /started) in the channel to mark game as ongoing which will make bot delete the game embed in #open-game and repost it without button in #games-archive

=> creator can use a command to mark game as finished (ex: /finished) which will delete the channel after some time (time can be edited by a command)

Notes:
-private channels created has names with numerical sequence (ex: #game-1  #game-2 ....)

-once a player is accepted to join its discord name will be added to embed msg in #open-games, same when the player leaves it is removed

-creator can delete the match (or kick someone) before using /started with a command
